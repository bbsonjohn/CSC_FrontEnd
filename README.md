_Description:_ The FrontEnd Module for CUHK muon telescope. The program is written using Atmel Software Framework (ASF). It is a program that interfaces the _Atmel Xmega256A3BAU Microcontroller_. The detail function of the program can be found in my [thesis](https://bbsonjohn.github.io/assets/MasterThesis.pdf).
